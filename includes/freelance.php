<p>This is my Mom's husband's company website I first designed and developed back in 2012. I redesigned it in 2016 making it mobile responsive and also adding Google Tag Manager elements to further track SEO data. It's a fun site to manage and also gratifying watching his business grow each year.</p>

<p>This is my friend Danette's company website I first designed and developed back in 2006. Danette is a ultra talented tattoo artist specializing in cosmetic tattooing (eyebrows, eyeliner, lips). I redesigned it in 2012 and as we speak am redesigning it for the third time. The new site will be built in Bootstrap 4, Sass and will be mobile responsive and have a new modern design with updated copy. Excited for everyone to see the new site!</p>
