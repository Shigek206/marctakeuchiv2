<p>Here are some of my fun "hobby" projects that allow me to get my hands dirty in code  and design during my down time away from work. The goal and purpose of my freelancing (especially in the early years) was to learn and for the enjoyment. The two sites I currently manage are both for family/friend with no plans on taking on any new projects.</p>

<p><strong>Aloha Airport Shuttle</strong> - Location: Honolulu, HI<br />
<a href="https://www.alohaairportshuttle.com" target="_blank" title="Aloha Airport Shuttle">www.alohaairportshuttle.com</a> (HTML5, Bootstrap 3, Sass, jQuery)</p>

<p>This is my Mom's husband's company website I first designed and developed back in 2012. I redesigned it in 2016 making it mobile responsive and also goals to further track SEO data. It's a fun site to manage and gratifying watching his business grow each year.</p>

<p><strong>Another You Permanent Cosmetics</strong> - Location: Seattle, WA<br />
<a href="https://www.danetteproszek.com/" target="_blank" title="Another You Permanent Cosmetics">www.danetteproszek.com</a> (HTML5, Bootstrap 4, Sass)</p>

<p>This is my friend Danette's company website I first designed and developed back in 2006. Danette is a ultra talented tattoo artist specializing in cosmetic/makeup tattooing (eyebrows, eyeliner, lips). I redesigned the site in 2012 and recently launched the 2020 version with a heavy emphasis with SEO! Look forward to fine tuning things in the next few months.</p>
